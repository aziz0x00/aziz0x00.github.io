## Algorithms and Datastructures
- CLRS book of course
- [Handbook of Competitive Programming](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) from CSES by Antti Laaksonen
- [MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms, Spring 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63EdVPNLG3ToM6LaEUuStEY)
- [Algorithms course at the University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2223/Algorithm1/) by Prof Frank Stajano, and the University site also contains alot of other useful informations
- [6.854/18.415 Advanced Algorithms](https://people.csail.mit.edu/moitra/854.html) from MIT \
    from the description of the course:
    > ... We will cover a wide variety of topics including hashing, dimension reduction, max flow, linear programming, semidefinite programming, approximation algorithms, multiplicative weights, gradient descent and compressed sensing, and bring students up to the level where they can read and understand research papers.
- [MIT 18.404J Theory Of Computation, Fall 2020](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-404j-theory-of-computation-fall-2020/video_galleries/video-lectures/)
- [6.045/18.400 Automata, Computability, and Complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhTlazaGAF8&list=PLmUkKyGlHupqtANK5Pmo1gjLlmW1pF1q7&index=1) and [course site](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-045j-automata-computability-and-complexity-spring-2011/pages/lecture-notes/)


## Security
- [Cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org) is a great place to learn modern cryptography effectively
- [angstromCTF past competitions](https://angstromctf.com/) are great for learning imo, you can play almost all past challenges locally, the past challenge files can be found [here](https://github.com/blairsec/challenges/tree/master/angstromctf).
- yo, this is probably all you need for resources on this subject: [CryptoCat Hacking Resources](https://github.com/Crypto-Cat/CTF)

## Background
- [MIT 6.002 Circuits And Electronics, Spring 2007](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-002-circuits-and-electronics-spring-2007/video_galleries/video-lectures/)
