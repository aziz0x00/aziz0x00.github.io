videos that I found very interesting talking about the process of learning and related things

- [How to turn information into intelligence | Barbara Oakley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlTDRuwKb_g) \
    I really like this one, as it's really full of facts and clarifies so much about how our we learn.
- [Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0)
- [The 4 things it takes to be an expert - Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eW6Eagr9XA)
