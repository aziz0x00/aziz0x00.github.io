> The difference between being poor and being moderately rich is very substantial. I encourage everyone to try to get moderately rich. Real trouble moves out of your brain and into somewhere else. But the difference between being moderately rich and very rich is substantially less impactful.

## General advice
- [How to Get Rich (without getting lucky) - Naval](https://x.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936)
    is a really nice list of bullet points.

## Startups
- [How to Build a Product that Scales into a Company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-98YRAF1dY)
- [David Heinemeier Hansson - Unlearn Your MBA (Entire talk)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlhAkNWC1qo)

    DHH honesty is refreshing. here's a more recent podcast with him that is related (which is great and motivated me to make this page!):
